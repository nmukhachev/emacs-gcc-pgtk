#+TITLE: emacs-gcc-pgtk - Dockerfile for building emacs.deb with native-comp and pure GTK

* Summary
This repository shows a Dockerfile to create a emacs-29 deb package with native compilation and pure GTK for Ubuntu >=20.04. 

** Notes:
1. The deb package can be found in [[https://github.com/nmukhachev/emacs-gcc-pgtk/actions/workflows/deploy.yml?query=is%3Acompleted][GitHub Action]].
2. The emacs source files are [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/?h=emacs-29][here]].
3. no xwidgets
4. no imagemagick. Emacs now supports resizing and rotating of images without ImageMagick.
5. all =.el= files are compiled ahead of time.
6. The emacs is built with sqlite, webp, tree-sitter
7. Ubuntu does not have  libtree-sitter-* packages yet. So this deb package contains these libraries.
** The package is compiled with flags:
+ --with-pgtk
+ --with-json
+ --with-gnutls
+ --with-rsvg
+ --without-xwidgets
+ --without-xaw3d
+ --with-mailutils
+ --with-native-compilation=aot
+ CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe"
